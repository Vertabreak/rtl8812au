### Removal of Driver
In order to remove the driver from your system open a terminal in the directory with the source code and execute the following command:
```
 sudo make dkms_remove
```

### Ubuntu install / Build dependencies
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install dkms git build-essential libelf-dev linux-headers-`uname -r` -y
git clone -b v5.6.4.2 https://github.com/Vertabreak/rtl8812au.git
cd rtl*
sudo make dkms_install
```

install complete reboot.


#### For Raspberry (RPI)

```
$ sudo apt-get install raspberrypi-kernel-headers
```

Then run this step to change platform in Makefile, For RPI 1/2/3/ & 0/Zero:
```
$ sed -i 's/CONFIG_PLATFORM_I386_PC = y/CONFIG_PLATFORM_I386_PC = n/g' Makefile
$ sed -i 's/CONFIG_PLATFORM_ARM_RPI = n/CONFIG_PLATFORM_ARM_RPI = y/g' Makefile
```

But for RPI 3B+ & 4B you will need to run those below which builds the ARM64 arch driver:
```
$ sed -i 's/CONFIG_PLATFORM_I386_PC = y/CONFIG_PLATFORM_I386_PC = n/g' Makefile
$ sed -i 's/CONFIG_PLATFORM_ARM64_RPI = n/CONFIG_PLATFORM_ARM64_RPI = y/g' Makefile
```

In addition, if you receive an error message about `unrecognized command line option ‘-mgeneral-regs-only’` (i.e., Raspbian Buster), you will need to run the following commands, then retry building and installing:
```
$ export ARCH=arm
$ sed -i 's/^MAKE="/MAKE="ARCH=arm\ /' dkms.conf
```

For setting monitor mode
  1. Fix problematic interference in monitor mode.
  ```
  $ airmon-ng check kill
  ```
  You may also uncheck the box "Automatically connect to this network when it is avaiable" in nm-connection-editor. This only works if you have a saved wifi connection.

  2. Set interface down
  ```
  $ sudo ip link set wlan0 down
  ```
  3. Set monitor mode
  ```
  $ sudo iw dev wlan0 set type monitor
  ```
  4. Set interface up
  ```
  $ sudo ip link set wlan0 up
  ```
For setting TX power
```
$ sudo iw wlan0 set txpower fixed 3000
```

### LED control

#### statically by module parameter in /etc/modprobe.d/8812au.conf or wherever, for example:

```sh
options 88XXau rtw_led_ctrl=0
```
value can be 0 or 1

#### or dynamically by writing to /proc/net/rtl8812au/$(your interface name)/led_ctrl, for example:

```sh
$ echo "0" > /proc/net/rtl8812au/$(your interface name)/led_ctrl
```
value can be 0 or 1

#### check current value:

```sh
$ cat /proc/net/rtl8812au/$(your interface name)/led_ctrl
```

### USB Mode Switch

0: doesn't switch, 1: switch from usb2.0 to usb 3.0 2: switch from usb3.0 to usb 2.0
```sh
$ rmmod 88XXau
$ modprobe 88XXau rtw_switch_usb_mode=int (0: no switch 1: switch from usb2 to usb3 2: switch from usb3 to usb2)
```

### NetworkManager

Newer versions of NetworkManager switches to random MAC address. Some users would prefer to use a fixed address.
Simply add these lines below
```
[device]
wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no
```
at the end of file /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and restart NetworkManager with the command:
```
$ sudo service NetworkManager restart
```
